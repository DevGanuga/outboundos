    category: "Getting Started",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "How quickly can Nova start booking meetings?",
        answer: "Nova typically starts booking meetings within 2-4 weeks of signup. Week 1 is onboarding and setup, weeks 2-3 involve launching campaigns and scaling, and by week 3-4 you'll see 10-30 qualified meetings booked."
      },
      {
        question: "What information do you need to get started?",
        answer: "We need your ideal customer profile (ICP), company messaging, CRM access, email domain setup, and calendar integration. Our onboarding team guides you through everything with a simple intake form."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need technical skills to use Nova?",
        answer: "No technical skills required! We handle all the setup, integration, and technical configuration. You just provide the business context and approve the messaging."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Performance & Results",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What if Nova doesn't book 10 meetings in 30 days?",
        answer: "Our 'Work Until It Works' guarantee means if Nova doesn't book at least 10 qualified meetings in your first 30 days post-launch, we'll continue running the system at no additional cost until it does. Plus, you keep all assets we build."
      },
      {
        question: "How does Nova achieve 500+ daily touches?",
        answer: "Nova uses advanced AI to work 24/7 across multiple channels (email, LinkedIn, voice drops). While a human SDR can manage 50 touches per day, Nova's automation and AI capabilities enable 10x that volume with higher personalization."
      },
      {
        question: "What's your average meeting show-up rate?",
        answer: "Our clients typically see 70-80% show-up rates because Nova qualifies prospects thoroughly before booking. We also send pre-meeting briefings and reminders to maximize attendance."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Technology & Integration",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Which CRMs does Nova integrate with?",
        answer: "Nova integrates with all major CRMs including HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Close, and more. We handle the integration during onboarding and ensure seamless data flow."
      },
      {
        question: "How does Nova personalize at scale?",
        answer: "Nova analyzes 10,000+ accounts daily for buyer signals, job changes, funding events, and tech stack data. It then uses AI to craft personalized messages based on these insights, ensuring relevance at scale."
      },
      {
        question: "Is my data secure with Nova?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We use enterprise-grade security, encrypted connections, and never share your data. All AI processing happens within secure environments, and you maintain full ownership of your data."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Pricing & Terms",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Are there any hidden fees?",
        answer: "No hidden fees. You pay a one-time setup fee of $3,500 (discounted from $5,000) and then $2,000/month. That's it. No per-meeting fees, no success fees, no surprises."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
        answer: "Yes, you can cancel your monthly retainer anytime with 30 days notice. There are no long-term contracts. You also keep all the assets we've built for you."
      },
      {
        question: "Why is this so much cheaper than an SDR?",
        answer: "A human SDR costs $120,000+ per year (salary, benefits, tools, training, replacement). Nova costs $27,500 in year one and delivers 10x the output without ever quitting or needing time off."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Comparison & Alternatives",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "How is this different from other AI tools?",
        answer: "Nova isn't just softwareâ€”it's a complete AI SDR system. We handle setup, optimization, and management. Unlike tools that require you to figure everything out, we deliver a done-for-you solution with guaranteed results."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I hire an SDR or use Nova?",
        answer: "If you need consistent pipeline without the hiring, training, and turnover headaches, Nova is ideal. Human SDRs cost 4x more, deliver 10x less volume, and quit every 6 months. Nova works 24/7 and never quits."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I already have SDRs?",
        answer: "Nova can complement your existing team by handling high-volume outreach while your SDRs focus on strategic accounts. Many clients use Nova to scale without hiring additional SDRs."
